I grew up around the Whitewell area in North Belfast/Newtownabbey. During my teens, I lived quite close to the zoo which was always good for monkeying around.

The reason why I went down the route of marketing was strange. I know now, it was due to the balance of being creative and analytical. 

I was always on the crossroads when it came to subjects like Math and Design. Marketing provided me with a happy medium. 

But back when I hadn't a clue what to do, I remember one cool story, which I guess introduced me to marketing. It went a little like this.
